# SwiftRope

An implementation of the Rope data structure. 

This is based on the original rope data structure paper, which you can find in [the wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180619190036/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.9450&rep=rep1&type=pdf). I also was watching [the Swift Talk](https://talk.objc.io) sessions on `fold` (see episodes 150 through 152), and used those concepts extensively.
